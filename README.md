# OWN IT

# DECENTRALIZED LAND PROPERTY OWNERSHIP TRANSFER

## About this project 

This project aims to solve a real-world problem by allowing land owners to create digital ownership records for their land and allowing users to purchase and verify these documents. Land owners can also submit private NFTs to restrict the visibility of ownership and privately upload their identity. Through this project, I gained a better understanding of how the blockchain works and how the blockchain system functions. I also learned practical skills such as how to build features for the blockchain and how smart contracts work when they are deployed to the internet. In addition, I learned about front-end best practices.

## Objective of this project:

The objective of this project was to solve a real-world issue in the field of real estate. The current process of transferring land ownership is centralized and has many disadvantages. My solution was to make land ownership transferable through the use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are decentralized. This allows anyone to buy and sell land securely.

Additionally, this solution helps to prevent real estate scams because land owners can easily access and verify the details of their land. This allows them to accurately determine the worth of their land.

## How it works
1) Log in with Arcana Auth to make transactions.
2) Land owners need to post their land data.
3) Users can browse and buy the available properties.
4) After purchasing the land, the ownership is transferred to the new owner.
5) The new owner can resell the land if they wish to.
